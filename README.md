# BwE PS3 Code Parser

![BwE](https://i.imgur.com/lTx7sXW.png)

I am BwE of betterwayelectronics.com.au and I have been creating software to validate the PlayStation's flash since 2008 with the help of psdevwiki.com :)
<p>I have made this program open source but it is also offered in a compiled .exe format for $10AUD ($6USD): https://buy.stripe.com/5kA4jgdDf1ps7fidSL
<p>The compiled version is identical to what is offered here on GitHub, so think of the purchase as a donation for my effort.
<p>I welcome people to add their own error codes to this program and I will publish updated .exe's when I have time. The next update will include a .txt parsing feature to read the codes in bulk.
